# Learning Objective 1: Understand the Evolution of Artificial Intelligence and its Historical Context

**Title:** From Abacuses to Algorithms: The Evolution of Artificial Intelligence

**Script:**

**[The stage is set with a large screen displaying a timeline of technological advancements. The presenter walks on stage, dressed smartly, with a clicker in hand.]**

**Presenter smiles and addresses the audience:**

"Good morning, everyone! Have you ever wondered how we leaped from counting on our fingers to asking our phones for the weather? Today, we're taking a thrilling journey through the evolution of Artificial Intelligence—no time machine needed!"

**[Slide changes to an image of an abacus.]**

"Let's start with the humble abacus, one of the earliest known calculating tools. It was the cutting-edge technology of its time—Mesopotamian accountants were the rock stars of ancient data processing!"

**[Audience chuckles.]**

**[Slide transitions to a photo of Alan Turing.]**

"Fast forward to the 1950s, and we meet Alan Turing, often called the father of modern computing. He posed a simple yet profound question: 'Can machines think?' This led to the creation of the Turing Test, a way to evaluate a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from a human. Think of it as the original CAPTCHA—except we're the ones trying to prove we're not robots!"

**[Light laughter from the audience.]**

**[Display shifts to images of early computers filling entire rooms.]**

"In those days, computers were so big they needed their own zip codes. Programmers had to navigate through a maze of vacuum tubes just to debug a program—literally!"

**[Presenter gestures widely to emphasize size.]**

**[Slide shows the Dartmouth Conference photo.]**

"Then, in 1956, the term 'Artificial Intelligence' was officially coined at the Dartmouth Conference. Enthusiasm was sky-high. Researchers thought that in a few decades, we'd have machines doing all sorts of intelligent tasks. It's like signing up for a gym membership and expecting to run a marathon next month."

**[Audience nods, some smiles.]**

**[Slide transitions to ELIZA chatbot image.]**

"The 1960s brought us ELIZA, one of the first chatbots, which mimicked a psychotherapist. Interacting with ELIZA was... an experience. It was like talking to that one friend who only responds with, 'How does that make you feel?' Not exactly deep conversation, but a monumental step nonetheless."

**[Presenter winks.]**

**[Slide darkens to represent the 'AI Winter.']**

"Then came the AI Winters of the 1970s and 80s—a period where AI research lost funding and interest. Expectations weren't met, and the hype bubble burst. It's the tech equivalent of promising flying cars by the year 2000. We're still waiting!"

**[Audience laughs softly.]**

**[Slide brightens to show IBM's Deep Blue and Garry Kasparov.]**

"But like any good comeback story, AI returned with a vengeance. In 1997, IBM's Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov. It was man versus machine, and this time, the machine won. Kasparov said he felt a 'new kind of intelligence' across the board—probably not the kind of uplifting inspiration he was hoping for!"

**[Audience laughs.]**

**[Slides now showcase modern AI applications: smartphones, smart homes, autonomous cars.]**

"Today, AI is everywhere. From Siri and Alexa—who are always listening, by the way—to recommendation algorithms that know you better than your best friend. 'Customers who bought this also bought...' How did they know I needed a waffle maker and a dog leash? I don't even have a dog!"

**[Audience laughs louder.]**

**[Presenter walks closer to the audience.]**

"Understanding this history isn't just about nostalgia. It's about appreciating the rapid advancements and recognizing patterns of hype versus reality. It teaches us that while technology evolves, so do our challenges and expectations."

**[Slides fade out to the title screen.]**

**Conclusion:**

"So there you have it—a whirlwind tour of AI's evolution. From mechanical calculators to machines that learn and adapt, AI's journey mirrors our own quest for knowledge and improvement. And trust me, the adventure is just beginning!"

**[Presenter smiles brightly.]**

"Thank you for joining me on this trip through time. Buckle up—because the future of AI is set to be a remarkable ride!"

**[Audience applauds as the presenter exits the stage.]**
