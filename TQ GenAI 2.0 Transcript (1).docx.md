# Executive Briefing: Prompt Engineering

## What Is Prompt Engineering?

When you first use a generative AI tool, any generative AI tool, you start with a blank slate. It's just you and this little empty box, and as the cursor blinks away, you might start to wonder, now what? You could ask questions, get help with a task, have a conversation, and depending on the tool, you could create digital art, videos, or music, and it all starts with a prompt or what you feed into the little box. And the first thing you should know, the quality of your prompt determines the quality of what you get back. I'm here to help you get better results from generative AI, whether that's ChatGPT, Google Bard, DALL‑E, Midjourney, or any number of AI‑backed tools that come into existence daily. You may have tried ChatGPT or another LLM like Google Bard or Claude; if so, I'm sure you've noticed results may vary. Sometimes it's great, and sometimes, well, it's not what you're looking for, and you might say, that's true, but why, and how can I change that? It really comes down to your prompts. It's about the practice of prompt engineering, which is a term that originates from machine learning, but for us it means something a little different. You can think of it as the art of creating specific and effective questions or statements for generative AI models in order to get the results you want. Together, we'll explore ideas like personas, tone, style, audience, length, also known as prompt attributes. And along the way, we'll learn terms like prompt chaining, context length, token limitations, and we'll also talk about an idea called shot‑based prompting, where you provide examples to the model, guiding the output, and flipping the role, where you approach a prompt from a completely different angle to vary the perspective. You can always just ask the model to explain model collapse, which will give you an explanation, but you'll find it better to ask the model to assume the role of an AI researcher and summarize model collapse for a general audience in a paragraph or two. The former works, but the latter provides a role, a subject, an audience, a purpose, and a length, which will greatly impact the quality of what you get back. Prompt engineering is all about getting the most out of generative AI, and it starts with planning a more successful prompt.

## Planning a Successful Prompt

Every piece of writing has certain qualities. They all have a length, a style, an audience, an intention. It's what makes the work unique, it defines the writing, and when you can keep this in mind, it'll make all the difference when you start writing prompts. Because, the first step when creating a new prompt shouldn't be just start typing; instead, sit back for a moment, think about the qualities of what you want to create, what you want the AI to help you create. Let's say you want ChatGPT to generate a production schedule for an upcoming conference, or outline an upcoming presentation, or maybe create a marketing campaign. Well, I have to pick something, so, I'm going to go with the marketing campaign, but everything we do with this prompt for marketing could just as well apply to the others or to any other example you pick. The process for working with and thinking about prompts remains the same. Let's say we sell chairs, and this month we want to feature the classic Eames Lounge Chair. So, we're going to use ChatGPT to help us create some marketing copy. Take another look at these. This is a novel, this is a white paper, this is a blog post. They all have those different qualities like length, tone, style, audience, and the same is true for a prompt, these qualities are called prompt attributes or prompts parameters. Okay, so we know we want some marketing copy and we have a subject, so let's start there and see what we get. Write some marketing copy, focusing on the Eames Lounge Chair. Okay, so what we get back is not terrible, if you consider how little information we gave it to work with. We told it to write some marketing copy, and we gave it a subject, that's it. Ignoring the content quality for now, let's begin with a prompt attribute that's often the first thing we want to tweak, and that's the content length. So, how do you communicate length? You might immediately think of word count, you know, give me 500 words of marketing copy, which is useful when you have a word or character limit, but, there's so many other ways to express length. Start with the medium of your message. Write a newsletter, write a blog post, a social media caption, a tweet. These all imply a length. Or, you could say, write a summary, write a short explanation, use five main points, give me three strategies. Each of these will produce unique outputs with a length that matches your request. You can also combine these to refine it further; write an article that takes 5 minutes to read, write an article that covers the topic in depth, write a social media post that can be read in a single scroll. Okay, with that in mind, let's refine our marketing prompt just a bit. Write some marketing copy for a newsletter that can be read in 3 minutes, focusing on the Eames Lounge Chair. So, this is pretty different from what we got originally, it now has a subject, a different tone, a different length, giving us more of what we asked for. So, remembering that this is a chat, a conversation, you can specify attributes like length as a continuing refinement, like, make it shorter or be more concise. Since I used a timeframe for reading, we can refine the prompt in the same way and say make it a 5‑minute read. Now, the title has changed, the tone updated a little, and it got longer, more detailed. Submitting a prompt that updates your request based on the previous output is really common for LL Ms. This is what's known as prompt chaining, where you give feedback on the previously generated text, treating it like a conversation, and you can give more than one piece of feedback at a time, so, let's do some more prompt chaining. We'll say, this is good, but remove the salutations, remove the signature, and suggest images. Now ChatGPT has given us much more to work with. With this, we have our newsletter, ready to be reviewed and edited by a human before sending it out. Okay, if you take one thing away with you from this, when starting out with prompts, it's all about mindset. Think about how written work of all kinds is described, and think about the qualities and attributes of each. Prompts are made up of the same stuff. Everything you want to create has a style, a purpose, an audience, and more. Try this as an exercise outside of a prompt. Grab a nearby book or a recent article you read and write down the attributes of that work. How long is it? What's the style? What's the audience? Describe the tone. What's its purpose? Having the right mindset is the first step to successfully using generative AI.

## The Most Useful Prompts Attributes in Generative AI

This book has many attributes. Just calling it a book is giving it an attribute ‑ format ‑ and all prompts, like this book, have attributes. There are so many different attributes you can apply when crafting a prompt, but the real question is what are the most useful ones, the ones you use all the time, or the ones that give you the best results? Format is a good place to start. Do you want the model to write you a book? Then, say so. But, you might want to start chapter by chapter. I say that because it's important to keep in mind that tools like ChatGPT have limits, two of which are token limits, or limits on how much content it can return in response to your prompt, and context length, which puts limitations on how much of your previous conversation it can remember. And these limitations, they change depending on what model you're using. Okay, back to format. We could say write an essay on the benefits of coffee, or create some dialog discussing the benefits of coffee, or maybe write a list summarizing the benefits of coffee, where each of these have the same subject, but different ways of specifying format, and alone, this can be really useful. But, if you add length as a second attribute to this, you can narrow the focus, think a thousand word essay, a five minute dialog, or a ten item list. What about the audience you want to reach? That's an important attribute to consider. How about the age group, educational background, the profession? You may need to consider the culture or even special interests to better direct the outcome. Sticking with the benefits of coffee, let's consider the domain as another attribute. We can make a choice to focus on the health benefits, the economic impacts, cultural benefits, boost to productivity, or neurological implications. Each of these will give us very different results. Pick one, or more than one. Remember, prompting is more of an art than a science. Let's go with create a list of the top 10 neurological and health benefits of coffee. So, we've considered format, length, audience, domain, but there are so many possibilities for us. We also provided the perspective of the writing. We asked for benefits or positives, but, what about the negatives? Should the writing be optimistic? Pessimistic? Maybe it needs to stay neutral. What about the tone? What's the mood of the work? Is it formal? Is it casual? Should it be funny? All content has a purpose. Do you want to entertain, educate, maybe influence? Now, one of my favorite attributes is asking the model to assume a role. Let's say I want to give a presentation on how to make a good espresso, and who knows the subject better than an experienced barista at a quality coffee shop? So, I could prompt, as an experienced barista at a quality coffee shop, guide a beginner through the step‑by‑step process of making the perfect espresso, where it might give you a list of instructions starting with one, choose high‑quality beans, start with fresh, quality coffee beans. Beans roasted for espresso are often medium to a dark roast. I'll spare you the entire list, but this is a direct way of researching what I want to present. Okay, I want to be clear, you don't have to use all of these at once, and you certainly don't need to begin with more than a few attributes. As there are endless ways to describe writing, there are endless ways to create a prompt. What you really need to know is that crafting a prompt is an art, one that requires open‑minded experimentation and a lot of practice. One last thing to consider, using a role, like the barista, is very useful, but you could even try what might be called flipping the role to get a different perspective. What if we tried this? As a coffee enthusiast who's recently acquired an espresso machine, list all the questions you could have about making the perfect espresso shot. That one might return, I've heard that making the choice of beans can make or break an espresso. What roast should I be looking for? Do I go for something labeled "espresso roast" or can any coffee bean work? Then, you can use these questions as a prompt, getting more detail on each part of the process. So, no longer just the perspective of the professor, the professional, or the expert, but that of the novice, of the learner.

## Flipping the Roles

If you ask ChatGPT, what's your purpose, it'll give you a short list. It exists to answer questions, assist with tasks, and engage in conversation. Now, conversation, answering questions, these are straightforward. But the power lies in assisting with tasks. You can get it to write lists, essays, blog posts, that you already knew. It'll give you step‑by‑step instructions on how to plan events, accomplish specific outcomes, really anything you can think of. But one of the most powerful ways to use a tool like ChatGPT or Bard is to see it as a research assistant or, better yet, an enthusiastic but immature intern. And you would never deliver an assistant's or intern's work as your own. So don't just ask it to generate something. Have it do some research. Then start the process. Then you create the work where you make the decisions and you decide the final outcome. One way we do this is by prompting with roles. Let me give you some general examples. Now, you're going to want to be more specific with your use cases, but the idea remains the same. Consider these. As a product manager, how do you ensure a product is on time and loved by users? As a creative director, how would you approach a global ad campaign? As a hiring manager, what do you look for in a leader? Now, these are going to give you good information from the point of view of the expert and specific domain, but this is only one perspective. And varying the perspective helps you get a better picture of what you're researching, more comprehensive results. We do that by flipping the role. So, we have the viewpoint of the product manager, but we also want the perspective of the product user. It's not just about the creative director's thoughts, but consumers that see ads all day. And not just the hiring manager, but potential candidates for an open leadership position. As a user, what do you want to see in a SaaS product? As someone who sees ads daily, what catches your eye? As a leadership candidate, what concerns you about a new job? Now, think about this. You're preparing to launch a new product. Now with role‑based prompts and generative AI, you can gather insights on design. You can get a better understanding of the market. Ask about user experience or even foresee challenges. It's like having a team of experts, users and critics all packed into one tool ready to advise you. And it's not all about what you ask, but who you're asking. You want other perspectives. Those unique perspectives give you a more complete picture. But beyond the data and the insights, there's another layer, empathy. When you step into other roles, you're not just gathering information. You're walking in someone else's shoes. This is the heart of design thinking, understanding, feeling, then creating. Whether you're crafting a product or weaving a story, that empathy, that understanding of diverse perspectives, can be the difference between good and great. When researching, assuming roles helps you create balanced and relatable results. And the benefits are not just in research. You can also flip roles to help develop new skills, like practice conflict resolution or spur innovation. Using diverse roles is a superpower of large language models, one that you should apply as often as possible. It's not just about asking the chef how to make the dish. Ask the customer what they like. Then maybe ask a critic for a good review. Then combine all that you learn to create the perfect meal. You're not just gathering diverse insights, but cultivating a mindset that's curious, open, and ever‑evolving, which is the heart of writing a good prompt. Experimentation is everything. Don't just ask the expert; ask the novice. Flip the role, gain a different perspective, and get better results.

## Advanced Prompts

Okay, if we're being honest, calling a prompt advanced is kind of subjective. It really depends on the person. Think about this. For a child who's just started to read, a chapter book might seem advanced, while to an adult it's an everyday read. Works like Ulysses or Crime and Punishment might be considered advanced for some but a staple for others. So, let's say an advanced prompt is just a prompt you haven't experimented with yet. You can start by combining different attributes. Using roles in prompting is super useful. Act as a teacher, act as a product manager, and so on. But what about combining a role with the time period? Imagine you're a historian in 2150 looking back at social media's impact on society or combining format like a list with time as well, asking for a chronological breakdown. List major art movements from 1850 to 1950 in order of occurrence. Okay, combining attributes is useful, but let's think bigger. What if our request was more specific, like much more specific. Instead of asking how is generative AI influencing industries like marketing, healthcare, and entertainment, we can ask this. Considering the pivotal role that generative AI plays in contemporary technological solutions‑‑‑ Okay, you get the idea that's a long prompt with much more provided to the model to get a more nuanced, detailed answer. Long prompts are one way to get more clarity in ambiguous situations, narrow down the kind of response you're looking for, and get more insightful answers. Another thing to try, asking for or prompting with multiple choice questions. You could say, ask me a multiple choice question to help me learn about prompt engineering. And if you give the wrong answer, it'll correct you and give an explanation, helping you learn. But you can also ask multiple choice questions. This could direct the model's attention, giving it a set of options to choose from, like which of the following best describes how OpenAI's GPT models obtain their knowledge? The model chooses an option and gives context around its decision. You're in essence streamlining the model's responses making validation, if that's what you're after, easier. Remember, you can always ask a followup question, which could be called interactive prompting, which is just you having a back‑and‑forth dialogue with the tool to refine the process. Another very useful prompting approach is called shot‑based prompting. This is where an LLM, like GPT, is provided with a certain number of examples or shots to help it both understand and complete a task. The number of examples or shots helps the model's comprehension of the request. Zero‑shot prompting is when you give the model a task with no examples like translate this from English to Dutch, good afternoon, and the model will respond solely based on its training data. One‑shot prompting is, well, where one example is given to guide the model. This one example helps orient the model, like translate the following from English to Dutch, good morning, goedemorgen. Now, translate good afternoon. Few‑shot prompting, think two or three‑shot, is where a few more examples are given before your request, and many‑shot prompting is where several examples are presented. So, at the core of shot‑based prompting is your ability to harness the model's vast training data and adaptive capabilities by providing examples from none to extensive. This is also a great way to define the format of what you want returned. Okay, what you have seen might not seem advanced anymore, just more interesting and dynamic ways to use an LLM to get the results you want. Now, it's your turn. Try this out, start a conversation, learn something new. You're bound to get some interesting results.

## Prompting in Other Generative AI

Just like every piece of writing has unique attributes, the same can be said for images, music, or film. Each of these share some attributes, but others are unique to each medium. Images have a type, a photo, a pencil sketch, an oil painting. They each have a style, a unique perspective that belongs to the artist, the filming. Films and images both have aspect ratios. Let's focus on images, but these ideas can be applied to most visual generative AI as well. Precise prompting is key here. A well‑crafted prompt greatly influences the quality and accuracy of the output. Attributes like style are important. Do you want abstract, realistic, or impressionist? You should also think about composition, the rule of thirds, leading lines, framing, and depth of focus all to help balance your images. What kind of color schemes are you looking for? Monochromatic, analogous, complementary. Applying color helps guide the mood and emotion in your images. Consider your subject. You may want to highlight or suppress specific elements. What's in the foreground? What's the focus? What's in the background? You can be direct with the mood you want. Do you want your image to be eerie, cheerful, melancholic, serene? Creating emotion‑driven visuals by supplying the mood. You could just ask for a cat, but you get much more by adding more detail and asking for a cat sitting under a rainy window with melancholic ambience. Consider applying the attribute of genre to your image. What does a fantasy‑themed prompt look like when compared to a real‑world scenario? Okay, this is just specifying attributes or a combination of attributes, but another technique to consider would be iteration. Most image generation models possess the ability to progressively refine your images through a series of subsequent prompts. You start by asking for a minimalist logo with a cat mascot, and maybe what it returns is a bit generic. So, you ask it to keep the original design but add some glasses and maybe a hat on the cat. Then, maybe you want to evoke a different emotion by changing the color scheme and so on until you're satisfied with the result. Another technique to try is the combination or merging of different styles and subjects. Maybe you want to merge the aesthetics of 1950s vintage advertisements with modern‑day tech to create a promotional poster for a new VR headset, which could also be considered asking for historical context as a style. So, the possibilities seem endless, yes, but I want you to consider a few challenges that you may face. The first is overspecification where you're overly descriptive, and it may lead to unexpected or undesired outputs where the model may choose to focus on some of your request but ignore or minimize the others. You have to work to strike the right balance between a detailed prompt and allowing the AI to be creative. You also have to manage ambiguity with prompts. Vague prompts can lead to wildly varied results. Asking for a fat cat in two separate requests could lead to very different results. Some of the most useful practices with image generation are refining your prompts through iteration, using generated images as new prompts that you then further refine and keeping track of what works for you. Maybe create a prompt library of sorts. What attributes and in what order give you the best results? It's really about experimentation, seeing what works and what doesn't, keeping the limitations of each model in mind and learning what it's capable of. When creating images, video, or music, think first about the specific traits that you're aiming for, iterate on what you get back, and don't be afraid to try something unique.
