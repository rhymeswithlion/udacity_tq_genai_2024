**Presenter addresses the audience seriously yet optimistically:**

"Hello, everyone. As we stand on the frontier of technological advancement, it's crucial to consider not just the 'how' but the 'who' and 'what'—who is affected and what it means for society."

**Job Displacement:**

"There's no sugarcoating it—AI will change the job landscape."

**[Slide displays statistics on job automation.]**

"Some roles may become obsolete, but new opportunities will also emerge. It's similar to the Industrial Revolution—challenging at first, but ultimately leading to progress."

**Regulatory Concerns:**

"Privacy is a significant concern."

**[Slide shows GDPR and other regulatory logos.]**

"Regulations like GDPR exist to protect personal data. Companies must ensure compliance to avoid hefty fines and, more importantly, to maintain public trust."

**Ethical Considerations:**

"AI can inadvertently perpetuate biases present in training data."

**[Example of biased AI decisions.]**

"It's like teaching a parrot phrases without considering the meaning—it might repeat something inappropriate without understanding the implications."

**Call to Action:**

"We have a responsibility to guide AI development ethically."

**[Presenter steps forward earnestly.]**

"By prioritizing transparency, fairness, and accountability, we can mitigate negative impacts."

**Comic Relief:**

"Plus, we want to prevent scenarios where AI decides that the optimal number of emails is infinite. Nobody wants an inbox full of 'friendly reminders'!"

**[Audience laughs lightly.]**

**Conclusion:**

"Addressing societal impacts isn't about fearing the future; it's about shaping it responsibly."

**[Presenter smiles reassuringly.]**

"Together, we can ensure that AI serves as a force for good, benefiting everyone."
