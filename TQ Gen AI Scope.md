The content is geared toward business leaders, decision-makers, and employees looking to understand how AI can impact both organizational processes and their personal productivity. The use cases include educating these individuals on how AI and machine learning (ML) tools can be applied in various industries, demystifying AI concepts, and offering practical insights into the benefits and limitations of these technologies in their business environment.

# Learning Objectives

## What will learners be able to do after completing this lesson?

**Guidelines**  
We recommend "backward design" for lesson development.  In a backward design model, we focus first on what the learner should be able to do after completing the lesson and then fill in the details about what we need to teach them to be able to do to perform those tasks.  We call these **Learning Objectives**.

Example Learning Objectives:  

* *Share a high-level description of what Quantum Computing is with a focus on how quantum computing differs from traditional computing*  
* *Share examples of how Quantum Computing is being used today*  
* *Describe the basic functionality of Threads and how to use it for your business*  
* *Explain how Threads can fit into your company’s broader social media strategy*

A lesson typically covers between 3-5 Learning Objectives.

**Learning Objectives for This Course**
